# Hi, Iâ€™m @Luh-code ðŸ‘‹
## About me
I am a hobby coder and cs student at the TU Darmstadt from germany.
I code in Zig in my freetime, and like making some games and experiments in Godot from time to time.
The language I dispise the most is Java.
I use NixOS.
## Currently
I am learning Vulkan and am trying to wrap my head around graphics and rendering technology.
Lately AI also caught my interest, so I am learning about the Transformer architecture and SD, aswell as novel view synthesis.
