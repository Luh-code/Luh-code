# Hi, Iâ€™m @Luh-code ðŸ‘‹
## About me
I am a hobby coder from germany.
I code in c++ in my freetime, and like making some games and experiments in Godot from time to time.
The language I dispise the most is Java.
I use Linux, but don't discriminate, as in the end it doesn't matter If you use Windows or Linux.  
_(Though sometimes my code may not run perfectly on windows)_
## Currently
I am learning Vulkan and am trying to wrap my head around graphics and rendering technology.  
Also I am incredibly excited for Google's Carbon lang to drop.
